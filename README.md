# __My first personal Python visualization projects using `pygame`__  
## Done: __Late 2021 / Early 2022__
<p>
  DISCLAIMER: Surely I'm not 100% happy with this code today, but hey, it's supposed to show how my Python journey started. I've always loved learing by doing, watching and experiencing something visually. Visualization has always been the hobby and passion of mine. So, here are some of my first <code>pygame</code> projects I managed to find on my hard drive. Obviously since I finished them couple of years ago, I didn't touch or change anything. This will be my legacy!
</p>
<h1>
  <br>A* Pathfinding</br>
</h1>
<p>
  Test <i>A* Pathfinding</i> algorithm on the <code>pygame</code> grid. User can choose starting cell <b>A</b> (by pressing <code>1</code>), ending cell <b>B</b> (by pressing <code>2</code>) and draw black obstacles (by pressing <code>3</code>). <code>Space</code> key starts the animation, and <code>R</code> key restarts the grid.

<h1>
  <br>Atari Breakout</br>
</h1>
<p>
  Simple recreation of 70' <i>Breakout</i> game made originally by <i>Atari</i>. User can control the bottom paddle by using <code>left</code> and <code>right arrow</code>. The ball speeds up after destroying certain amout of bricks, just like in the original.

<h1>
  <br>Bubblesort</br>
</h1>
<p>
  Visualization of the most popular and not-so-efficient sorting algorithm. User can input how many elements they want to start with. <code>A</code> key means Ascending sorting, <code>D</code> means Descending order. <code>Space</code> key starts the animation, <code>R</code> key reshuffles starting items. Additionaly, the UI shows number of elements, comparisons, swaps and time.

<h1>
  <br>Game of Life</br>
</h1>
<p>
  Simulation of the most popular <b>cellular automaton</b> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StanisÅ‚aw_Ulam" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a>. Alive cells are distributed randomly on the grid. <code>Space</code> key starts the animation, <code>R</code> key reshuffles starting alive cells.

</div>
<h1>
  <br>Random Walker</br>
</h1> 
<p>
  Simulation of the mathematical concept know as a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk" target="_blank">Random Walk</a>". The single black cell starting in the middle has 1/4 chances to go up, down, left or right. It's path sometimes creates interesting art.
